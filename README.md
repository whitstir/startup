# Commonly

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. 

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Moving into a new apartment is exciting, but keeping everything organized with roommates get stressful. Commonly is a web app that makes shared living easier by centralizing all the essentials: a customizable chores list, shared calendar, and even an interactive house view. It keeps everyone on the same page, reduces miscommunication, and ensures no task or event gets overlooked. With Commonly, living together becomes smoother, more collaborative, and a lot more fun!

- **React** - Used to develop the interactive house, calendar, and progress bars.
