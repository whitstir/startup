# CS 260 Notes

## First Ever Notes

Today I learned how to push and commit things into GitHub using the VS Code app, the web-version of GitHub, and also by using the console. It was also very interesting to learn about the personal access tokens and how to set those up. I had to google how to set that up because the first time I did, I forgot to specify the repository and permissions.
