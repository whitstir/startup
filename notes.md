# CS 260 Notes

## First Ever Notes

Today I learned how to push and commit things into GitHub using the VS Code app, the web-version of GitHub, and also by using the console. It was also very interesting to learn about the personal access tokens and how to set those up. I had to google how to set that up because the first time I did, I forgot to specify the repository and permissions.

## AWS

Today I learned how to create an EC2 instance with the class AMI. I also figured out how to create the key pair and saved it to a safe place on my computer for easy and secure access. The command for shelling into the server is ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address] and will take me to the ubuntu home directory. Another thing that I learned is how to create an elastic IP address for my server instance. The link to my public server is http://34.233.208.96

### HTML Deliverable

I created the HTML deliverable, which included a basic outline of the structure of my website. It doesn't look like much now, since most of the content will be coming from other interactive things like REACT or Javascript. I learned how to properly format a website by using the correct tags, linking pages to one another, adding images, and using some buttons. 


## CSS

CSS Flex - https://codepen.io/Whitney-Stirling/pen/KwVVVMW?editors=1100

I learned how to use flex to make resposive websites for different sized screens. This will be very useful as I start developing my website that I want people to access from their phones, tablets, and computers.
